	<p>Hi <%=@seller.short_name%>,</p>
	<p>Thank you for reviewing your shop. That helps us out more than you know.</p>

	<p>Since you were one of the first few users to use <%= SITE_NAME %> from start to finish, Iâ€™m really curious to know what you think.</p>

	<p>No online survey here. Just reply back and be brutally honest. Any comments, positive or negative are deeply appreciated.</p>
	<p>Sincerely,</p>
